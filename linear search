Linear search is used to search for a specific value in an arrangement of sorted or unsorted file.

Algorithm

1. Start
2. Enter the no of variables in list (array).
3. Enter all values.
4. Enter the variable to be searched.
5. Search for the given variable in the array using a for loop.
   for (c = 0; c < n; c++)
   {
      if (array[c] == search)     /* if required element found */
      {
         printf("%d is present at location %d.\n", search, c+1);
         break;
      }
   }
   if (c == n)
      printf("%d is not present in array.\n", search)
6. Stop

Time Complexity 

Here, the whole loop has to be iterated until the needed element is found. Hence, time taken varies linearly with the size of the array. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n).
