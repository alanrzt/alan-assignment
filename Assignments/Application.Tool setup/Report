Task 1. Fork GIT repository from the GIT TEST REPO URL
           This is done by forking the given URL to my github account.Thus I got access to  https://github.com/arunpratheep92/testRepo .
           Step 1:Copying the given URL
           Step 2: Adding to my repository.
Task 2. Merge “Branch 2” with “Master” and resolve conflicts if any using a pull request.
             I used commands for merging branch2 with master in the terminal. The occured conflict was resolved as specified. 
            Steps  :cd testRepo
                       git checkout master
                       git merge branch2             #conflict
                       gedit Scene\ 7.txt
                       git add Scene\ 7.txt
                       git commit -m "conflict solved"
                       git push origin master

Task 3. Revert back your code to “Scene 3 Good Commit” commit.
            Steps :git checkout branch3
                       git checkout aa79262f8cd727df6a1f77469ce8a7f2d50180e7 Scene\ 3.txt
                       git add Scene\ 3.txt
                       commit -m "Revert good commit"
                       push origin branch3

Task 4. Create a new branch ‘Branch4’ containing all the files of “Master”
            I also learned to create new branch, both with github and terminal.
            Steps :git checkout -b branch4    #adding data
                       git push origin branch4

Task 5. Create a new file called ‘Bad File’ in Branch4 and commit it locally. Also add few files to git ignore and commit the changes.
           Steps :gedit badfile
                      git add badfile
                      git commit -m "4th line,commit3"    
                      gedit .gitignore(*.txt)
                      git add .gitignore(*.txt)
                      git commit -m "ignore file"
                      git push origin branch3    

Task 6. Now revert “Bad File” commit and push other changes if any.
           Steps : git reset --hard HEAD~1
                       git push origin branch3
